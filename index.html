  <!-- ================= INTRODUCTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks was created with a simple idea: modern businesses
      depend on technology, and weak infrastructure creates real business
      problems. Downtime, slow systems, security risks, and unplanned growth
      can hold organizations back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focus on designing IT and network infrastructure that is structured,
      reliable, and easy to scale. Instead of quick fixes, we build systems
      that are meant to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach combines technical clarity with business understanding,
      ensuring that every solution aligns with real operational needs.
