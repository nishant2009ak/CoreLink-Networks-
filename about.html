  <!-- ================= COMPANY STORY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks was founded with a clear understanding of a
      common problem in modern organizations: technology grows fast,
      but infrastructure planning often falls behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many businesses rely on systems that were built quickly,
      expanded without structure, and secured as an afterthought.
      Over time, this creates instability, security risks, and
      operational inefficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks exists to solve this problem by focusing on
      strong foundations rather than temporary fixes.

  <section>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to help organizations build IT and network
      infrastructure that is reliable, secure, and scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to reduce complexity, improve visibility, and ensure
      that technology supports business goals instead of becoming
      a source of constant issues.
    </p>

      CoreLink Networks strives to become a trusted infrastructure
      partner for businesses that value stability, security, and
      long-term growth.
