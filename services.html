    <h2>Enterprise Infrastructure Services</h2>
    <p>
      Modern organizations rely heavily on stable and secure IT infrastructure.
      Weak or poorly designed systems can lead to downtime, security risks,
      and operational inefficiencies that directly impact business outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At CoreLink Networks, we focus on building infrastructure that supports
      growth, reduces complexity, and remains manageable over time.

  <!-- ================= SERVICE: ENTERPRISE NETWORKING ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Enterprise Networking</h2>
    <p>
      A strong network is the backbone of every digital operation. Enterprise
      networking requires careful planning, scalability, and security at
      every layer of the architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We design and implement LAN and WAN infrastructures that deliver high
      performance, reliability, and future readiness.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enterprise LAN and WAN architecture design</li>
      <li>Structured cabling and topology planning</li>
      <li>Network segmentation and traffic optimization</li>

  <!-- ================= SERVICE: CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Cloud Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud infrastructure offers flexibility and scalability, but without
      proper planning it can introduce cost, security, and performance challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We help organizations design cloud and hybrid environments that balance
      control, performance, and long-term cost efficiency.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud readiness assessment and migration planning</li>
      <li>Hybrid and cloud-native infrastructure design</li>
      <li>Network integration and connectivity planning</li>

  <!-- ================= SERVICE: NETWORK SECURITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>
      Security is a critical requirement for modern IT environments.
      Threats, misconfigurations, and lack of visibility can expose
      organizations to serious risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our network security services integrate protection directly into
      the network design to reduce risk and improve visibility.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security-focused network architecture</li>
      <li>Firewall planning and access control</li>
      <li>Network segmentation and isolation</li>
      <li>Traffic monitoring and security visibility</li>

  <!-- ================= SERVICE: MANAGED SERVICES ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Managed Services</h2>
    <p>
      Infrastructure requires continuous attention to remain stable,
      secure, and efficient. Many organizations lack the internal
      resources to manage systems effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our managed services provide ongoing monitoring, optimization,
      and guidance to ensure infrastructure reliability over time.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure health monitoring</li>
      <li>Performance optimization and issue prevention</li>
      <li>Configuration review and guidance</li>
      <li>Documentation and operational support</li>
