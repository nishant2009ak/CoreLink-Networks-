  <section>
    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks was founded by <strong>Nishant Raj</strong> with a
      clear focus on understanding how modern organizations depend on
      reliable and secure infrastructure to operate effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than approaching technology as isolated tools, the focus
      behind CoreLink Networks is on building structured systems that
      support performance, security, and long-term scalability.

  <!-- ================= MINDSET ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Founder’s Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      The foundation of CoreLink Networks is built on disciplined thinking
      and a strong interest in enterprise networking, cloud infrastructure,
      and security-focused design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The belief is simple: infrastructure should reduce complexity,
      improve visibility, and support business goals — not become a source
      of constant troubleshooting.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= WHY CORELINK ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why CoreLink Networks Was Created</h2>
    <p>
      Many organizations rely on systems that were built quickly,
      expanded without structure, and secured as an afterthought.
      Over time, this creates instability, performance issues,
      and unnecessary risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks was created to address these challenges by
      focusing on strong foundations, clear documentation, and
      security-aware architecture from the beginning.
