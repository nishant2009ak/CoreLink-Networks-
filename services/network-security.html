  <!-- ================= INTRODUCTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Network security is a foundational requirement for any organization
      operating in a connected environment. As infrastructure grows,
      poorly secured networks increase exposure to unauthorized access,
      data leakage, and operational disruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks integrates security directly into network design,
      ensuring protection, visibility, and control without unnecessary
      complexity.
