  <!-- ================= INTRODUCTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Enterprise networking is the foundation of every modern organization.
      Applications, data access, security controls, and cloud connectivity
      all depend on a reliable and well-designed network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poorly planned networks lead to downtime, slow performance,
      security exposure, and operational inefficiencies.
      CoreLink Networks focuses on building enterprise-grade networks
      that are stable, scalable, and easy to manage.
