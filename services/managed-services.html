  <!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Service Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Building infrastructure is only the first step. Without continuous
      monitoring, maintenance, and optimization, even well-designed systems
      can degrade over time and create operational risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks provides managed services that focus on stability,
      visibility, and long-term reliability. We help organizations maintain
      control over their infrastructure while reducing operational burden.
