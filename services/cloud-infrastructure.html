  <!-- ================= INTRODUCTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud infrastructure enables organizations to scale faster,
      improve availability, and modernize application environments.
      However, unplanned or poorly designed cloud adoption often results
      in high costs, security gaps, and operational complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      CoreLink Networks helps organizations design cloud and hybrid
      infrastructure with structure, control, and long-term sustainability
      in mind.
